refactor(ddd): Phase 2.2.3 - Replace Maps with Repository
Domain services now use Repository pattern instead of Maps.
PlanDomainService:
- planRegistry -> PlanRepository
- planSmRegistry -> PlanRepository StateMachine methods
- Constructor still has 11 params (first is PlanRepository)
TaskDomainService:
- Removed 4 Map params from constructor (10 -> 7 params)
- All Map operations replaced with TaskRepository calls
- 18 usages updated across all methods
No compilation errors. Only warnings for unused methods (expected).
